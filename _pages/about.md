- I am a Ph.D. candidate in [Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering (ECE)](https://ece.hkust.edu.hk/) at [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk/), supervised by [Prof. Jun Zhang](https://eejzhang.people.ust.hk/). I received my B.Eng in [School of Electronic Information and Enginnering](http://www2.scut.edu.cn/ee/main.htm) from [South China University of Science and Technology (SCUT)](https://www.scut.edu.cn/new/) in 2021.

📌 My research interests lie in Neural Data Representation & Compression, Generative AI and Edge AI.

✉️ Welcome to contact me for any discussion and cooperation!

💥 💥 **I anticipate graduating in 2025 and am open to both academic and industrial research positions in North America and Asia. If you are interested, please feel free to contact me.** 💥 💥
